--  EllesmereUI Shared Ticker
--
--  Self-disarming OnUpdate drivers: a driver frame only exists-as-running
--  while at least one subscriber is registered, so an idle UI runs no
--  per-frame code at all.
--
--  ATTRIBUTION (probe-verified 2026-07-26): the engine bills a script
--  handler's ENTIRE call tree to the addon whose execution context called
--  CreateFrame for the frame carrying the handler. The handler closure's
--  origin does not matter; who called SetScript does not matter; only the
--  frame's birth context matters -- and that context is inherited from the
--  current engine entry point (taint-style), NOT from the file the code
--  lives in. OnInitialize/OnEnable run under the parent's lifecycle
--  dispatch, so frames created there are billed to the PARENT forever.
--
--  Because of that rule there are two ways to use this module:
--
--    * EllesmereUI.Tick.Add/Remove -- the shared driver. Its frame is
--      created in this (parent) file, so ALL subscriber work is billed to
--      the parent addon. Fine for parent-owned work only.
--
--    * EllesmereUI.Tick.NewDriver(frame) -- per-addon driver. The caller
--      passes a frame it created in its OWN MAIN CHUNK (file scope), which
--      stamps the frame to that addon; every subscriber tick then bills the
--      subscribing addon. The driver logic living here in parent code is
--      irrelevant to attribution -- only the frame's birth context counts.
--
--  Usage:
--      -- child file scope:
--      ns.Drv = EllesmereUI.Tick.NewDriver(CreateFrame("Frame"))
--      -- anywhere:
--      ns.Drv.Add("erb_cast", function(dt) ... end)
--      ns.Drv.Remove("erb_cast")
--
--  Contract (identical for the shared driver and per-addon drivers):
--    * Add is idempotent. Calling it again with the same key replaces the
--      function and does not duplicate the entry, so an event handler can arm
--      unconditionally without first checking whether it is already armed.
--      That is deliberate: a missed re-arm freezes a bar, so callers should
--      always arm rather than trying to be clever about whether it is needed.
--    * A subscriber MUST remove itself once its work has settled (animation
--      reached its target, cast ended, cooldown finished). Removing from
--      inside your own tick is safe and is the normal way to do it.
--    * Remove on an unregistered key is a no-op, so pairing every start with
--      a stop is always safe.
--    * dt is real elapsed time since the previous dispatch, so animation
--      speed matches a per-frame OnUpdate exactly.
--
--  Note: EllesmereUI_Glows.lua deliberately keeps its own private driver. It
--  already implements this same arm/disarm discipline and is already free
--  when idle, so there is nothing to gain by routing it through here.

-- swapped out first, so an fn may Defer again (next drain), and each fn is
-- error-isolated. The event is registered only while something is pending, so idle
-- is free. Callers keep their own InCombatLockdown() gate: a Defer made out of combat
-- waits for the NEXT combat end. There is no cancel, and queues drain in no set order
-- relative to each other, so a queued fn must re-read live state when it runs. Each
