-- pointed at a missing file for the whole session (which kills floating text

-- The success boolean it returns when it does NOT raise is a different signal
-- and is not evidence of loadability: field capture (8.7.8) has it returning
-- false for a font file the very same call proved present, in a session where
-- a stock Blizzard path raised. Reading that false as "missing" vetoed a font
-- that was there. So: raised = the client could not find the file, anything

--  Undocked chat window position fix
--
--  Root cause, arithmetically pinned by the field drift capture (2026-07-28).
--  UIParent's height in UI units is always 768 / scale, so it is 1440 at our
--  pixel-perfect 0.5333 but 1200 at the tester's CVar scale 0.64. Blizzard
--  stores an undocked window's position as a screen-height RATIO and restores
--  it as ratio * GetScreenHeight(). Blizzard applies the CVar scale during
--  login and we apply ours at PLAYER_LOGIN, AFTER the chat restore has
--  already run -- so the restore resolves the ratio against the 1200 space:
--      correct : 0.1566 * 1440 = 225.5   (where the user dropped it)
--      restored: 0.1566 * 1200 = 187.9   (where it reappeared)
--  Then we rescale UIParent to the 1440 space and the frame keeps that
--  numeric 188 offset, which now points somewhere lower. Each session
--  repeats it, so the window creeps toward the bottom-left by
--  (cvarScale height / our height) per login. Only setups whose EUI scale
--  differs from the CVar scale drift, which is why not everyone sees it.
--
--  Fixing the scale TIMING does not work: applying our scale at ADDON_LOADED
--  (kept above, harmless) is overwritten by Blizzard's own CVar apply later
--  in login, so the restore still runs at the CVar scale. The position has
--  to be recomputed after both the restore and our final scale, which is what
--  this pass does -- Blizzard's own formula, against the settled space.
--
--  TAINT NOTE -- anchoring a Blizzard chat frame from insecure code is the
--  injector class this module's bisect ledger convicted, so this pass was
--  suspected of causing the field ChatFrameEditBox.lua:360 secret-SetText
--  error and was removed entirely in v6. The error reproduced on v6, a build
--  whose only chat contact is read-only getters -- so the pass is NOT the
--  vector and is restored here. That error is tracked separately as a
--  pre-existing chat-module issue. Exposure is still kept minimal: ONE
--  deferred pass per login, never during a session, no hooks, and nothing
--  written to Blizzard frame state (SetPoint only). Do not add the
--  FCF_SavePositionAndDimensions hook, the SetUserPlaced writes, or the
--  UPDATE_CHAT_WINDOWS registration back -- all three were separately
--  pulled, none of them bought anything.

-- NOTE: the global _G.STANDARD_TEXT_FONT override that used to live here was
-- removed. It was gated on the "Reskin Blizzard Elements" (customTooltips) toggle
-- and read a dead legacy key (EllesmereUIDB.fontSettings.global), so it always
-- forced STANDARD_TEXT_FONT to the bundled Expressway.TTF -- a Latin-only face --
-- regardless of the user's actual font choice. In CJK/Cyrillic locales that broke
-- glyphs across the whole Blizzard UI AND other addons (square boxes), because it
-- bypassed the locale-aware ResolveFontName fallback.
--
-- Changing the global game-text font is now handled exclusively by the opt-in,
-- locale-aware EllesmereUI.ApplyGlobalFontToGameText() ("Apply to All Game Text"),
-- which runs once at PLAYER_LOGIN. Reskinned Blizzard elements still pick up the
-- EllesmereUI font on their own via per-element, locale-aware SetFont calls
-- (EllesmereUI.GetFontPath("blizzardSkin")), so reskinning no longer touches the
-- global font and never affects other addons.
